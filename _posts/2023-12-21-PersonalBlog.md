# Test Corrections 

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## Question 7

![Question 7](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/741078771754336347/1187656715693465630/q7.png?ex=6597ae82&is=65853982&hm=c56b1cd5be19d1c066f47191652b4d626bf63f82ea40580414ebf0c627d0cac6&)

Answer/Explanation: I likely made this mistake by misreading the problem and not realizing exactly what it was asking. Now the answer seems more apparent after reading the solution. 

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## Question 15

![Question 15](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/741078771754336347/1187656742792859659/q15.png?ex=6597ae89&is=65853989&hm=f6fb1304ec5e2233d256d1c936551ebd32b8331c0ee50e7af3ecee509f059136&)

Answer/Explanation: Conceptual error, interchanging the display block with the operation of adding 1 will keep the number of values outputted the same but each value will be 1 greater in Program B. Program B would output numbers 2-11 while A would produce numbers 1-10. Therefore the answer choice "Program A and program B display the same number of values, but the values differ" is correct over Program A and program B display identical values.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## Question 21

![Question 21](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/741078771754336347/1187656769049202718/q21.png?ex=6597ae8f&is=6585398f&hm=90a9f7f8b4d5c4b8c8bf71d6240167e29d781b164351c5105762f9eed220dacd&)

Answer/Explanation: Rereading problem and answer, it is clear I choice the wrong selection, I suppose that I was confused by the wording of each answer and now understand my mistake. 

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## Question 37

![Question 37](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/741078771754336347/1187656807297064991/q37.png?ex=6597ae98&is=65853998&hm=3a70f27cc7f63acaeb136024d173420f73e78d11bea12622402948f15cf02c0e&)

Answer/Explanation: The order of the parameters matter in the code, my answer choice skips the first iteration, the line between the points 
(2,6) and (8,8).

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## Question 39

![Question 39](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1085799995548106872/1170943550716923924/question_46.png?ex=655ae129&is=65486c29&hm=9c2a0389762da0dc8f8204cd0250dea4a06b2e2c80c77b7fcd5dc8ba485d6e93&)

Answer/Explanation:  The program does not include the first element of the list in the sum because i is incremented before nums[i] is added to sum. By interchanging these two lines of code, the program will include all of the first ten elements of the list when computing the sum. Additionally, my answer choice was wrong because the program already iterates through first 10 terms.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## Question 42

![Question 42](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1085799995548106872/1170945231424868432/q65.png?ex=655ae2ba&is=65486dba&hm=8f56ce818a004f97a34fd56ac9a9221533fc1afa32895998780d63b72f8aaad7&)

Answer/Explanation: Option D contains a Boolean expression is true if and only if score is between target - 10 and target + 10, inclusive. Therefore, it evaluates to true if and only if score is in the desired range. My answer choice in the first parameter had a flaw allowing the difference to be greater than 10.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## Question 50

![Question 50](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/741078771754336347/1187656918295126116/q50.png?ex=6597aeb2&is=658539b2&hm=962a372762c34dd2caf2cacbaa9ade2809d376c92dd801f71782f3c9e4b9a332&)

Answer/Explanation: For an algorithm to run in reasonable time, it must take a number of steps less than or equal to a polynomial function. Algorithm I accesses elements times (twice for each of n elements), which is considered reasonable time. Algorithm II accesses elements (n times for each of n elements), which is considered reasonable time. Algorithm III accesses 10 elements, which is considered reasonable time. Therefore all algorithms ran with reasonable time.  

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## Question 56

![Question 56](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/741078771754336347/1187656939446992966/q56.png?ex=6597aeb7&is=658539b7&hm=c95ff917d230a0978577f414ba52fbcfe5ae5d03a623221411800ca2e1be9962&)

Answer/Explanation: Correct. Version I calls the GetPrediction procedure once for each element of idList, or four times total. Since each call requires 1 minute of execution time, version I requires approximately 4 minutes to execute. Version II calls the GetPrediction procedure twice for each element of idList, and then again in the final display statement. This results in the procedure being called nine times, requiring approximately 9 minutes of execution time.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## Question 62

![Question 62](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/741078771754336347/1187656961261568062/q62.png?ex=6597aebd&is=658539bd&hm=732c4beadabff2a2159d9d36605adffe17f22d9f03613540ee5b558e823edbf3&)

Answer/Explanation: I selected the values that evaluated the function to false. I am not sure if I read the question wrong due to lack of concentration or just thought I was selecting the programs outputting false. It is obvious that I am wrong, the programs with OR gates as their parameter or operation will most likely output true if x is set to true and y to false. 

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## Question 65

![Question 65](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/741078771754336347/1187656981784318022/q65.png?ex=6597aec2&is=658539c2&hm=ac8efb4059288e18a37f62d1800434b4906ea811e0aebd88dffd08c78300cbd8&)

Answer/Explanation: This question at first was hard for me to understand. However, realizing the order in concatenation of words to form jackalope helped me understand why the two correct answers. 

The one I selected that was correct stores the substring "jack" in animal. It then concatenates "jack" and "a", storing the result "jacka" in animal. Lastly, it concatenates "jacka" and the substring "lope", storing the result "jackalope" in animal.

The other correct answer reversed this process, storing the substring "lope" in animal. It then concatenates "a" and "lope", storing the result "alope" in animal. Lastly, it concatenates the substring "jack" and "alope", storing the result "jackalope" in animal.
